# Advent of Code 2017

I've decided to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the [Advent of Code 2017 challenge](http://adventofcode.com/).
These are my solutions for each day, all of which successfully passed that days challenge.

For now, all entries take no input parameters, and request all they need when they run.
Invalid inputs will probably panic %)

Lots of the code (especially from the earlier days) may not be idiomatic. If you see a more Rustual way of doing
something, let me know! I'm keen to learn more about the language.
